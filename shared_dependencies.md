As an AI, I'm unable to directly access and read files from external repositories. However, I can guide you on how to identify shared dependencies among your files.

1. **Shared Libraries/Modules**: Look for import statements at the beginning of your Python files. Shared libraries will be those imported across multiple files. For example, if you see `import numpy` in multiple files, then numpy is a shared dependency.

2. **Shared Variables**: Shared variables will be those declared in one file and used in another. These can be identified by their usage across multiple files.

3. **Shared Data Schemas**: If your files are using a common data structure or database, the schema for that data will be a shared dependency. Look for definitions of these schemas in your files.

4. **Shared DOM Elements**: If your files contain JavaScript that manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM), the id names of the DOM elements that are used by multiple JavaScript functions are shared dependencies.

5. **Shared Message Names**: If your files use a messaging system (like MQTT or RabbitMQ), the names of the messages that are used across multiple files are shared dependencies.

6. **Shared Function Names**: If functions are defined in one file and used in another, these are shared dependencies. Look for function calls that match the names of functions defined in other files.

To get a comprehensive list of dependencies, you would need to manually go through each file and note down the shared dependencies as per the categories above. Alternatively, you could write a script to automate this process.
